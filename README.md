## About
This project contains the Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS) algorithms for graphs. Both algorithms were implemented using a recursive method to ensure that the algorithms would work on larger, more complex graphs. 

## Execution
This program takes four arguments in a specific order. They are as follows:
-	1 = BFS, 2 = DFS
-	Name of starting vertex, ex.  v0 
-	1 = Directed, 2= Undirected
-	The full path from the program main directory to the benchmark file

Example input: 1 v3 2 ./src/graph/examples/STRONGLYCC.bench

## Results
Once the program is run, the results will be displayed on the console. You will find the following information :
- 	The options selected in the input arguments. 
- 	The vertices, their connections, and the edges (as found in the input benchmark file)
-   The resulting search order using the input arguments
